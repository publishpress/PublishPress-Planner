PublishPress Planner has all the tools you need to plan WordPress content including a Content Calendar, Content Overview, and Kanban Board.

== Description ==

[PublishPress Planner](https://publishpress.com/publishpress/) has all the tools you need to plan WordPress content including a Content Calendar, Content Overview, Kanban Board, content notifications, and more.

PublishPress Planner is ideal for WordPress sites that publish and promote high-quality content. Our goal is to help you publish content from inside WordPress. Our aim is to build SaaS-style features in WordPress so people don't need an extra service to plan your content. Why use Trello, ClickUp, Notion, CoSchedule, or other products when you already have WordPress?

## PublishPress Planner Pro ##

> <strong>Upgrade to PublishPress Planner Pro</strong><br />
> This plugin is the free version of the PublishPress Planner plugin. The Pro version comes with all the features you need to plan and schedule WordPress content. <a href="https://publishpress.com/publishpress"  title="PublishPress Planner Pro">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress content scheduling plugin now!</a>

## Content Calendar ##

The Content Calendar gives you a powerful overview of your publishing schedule. This screen works as a marketing calendar and an editorial calendar. You can easily see when content is planned, and when it was published. You can also drag-and-drop content to a new publication date. By default, you see all the WordPress content you have planned for the next few weeks. If you need to drill down, you can filter the calendar by post status, categories, users or post types.

## Content Overview ##

The Content Overview screen is a companion to the Calendar screen. Whereas the Calendar allows you to see content organized by dates, Content Overview allows you to drill down and see content organized by status, categories, or users. This content organizer allows to choose any data from WordPress to show in columns. In the top-right corner is a “Print” button. Click this to get a printable overview of all your planned content.

[Click here to read about the Content Overview](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/content-overview/).

## Content Board ##

The Content Board screen is a kanban board that you can use to organize your content. The Content Board provides one column for each status. You can drag-and-drop posts to change their status between Draft, Pending Review, Published, Scheduled, and more.

[Click here to read about the Content Board](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/the-content-board-screen/).

## Notifications ##

Notifications keep you and your team up to date on changes to important content. Users can be subscribed to notifications for any post, either individually or by selecting user groups. PublishPress Planner allows you to create powerful notification workflows based on post types, categories, status changes and much more.

[Click here to read about the Content Notifications](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/notifications/).

## Editorial Comments ##

A very important feature in PublishPress Planner is commenting. You can leave comments under each post you write. This is a private conversation between writers and editors and allows you to discuss what needs to be changed before publication.

[Click here to read about the Editorial Comments](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/editorial-comments/).

## Editorial Fields ##

Editorial Fields enables you to keep track of important requirements for your content. This feature allows you to create fields and store information about content items. By default, PublishPress Planner provides 4 examples of metadata, but you can add your own to meet your team’s needs.

## Slack Notifications ##

This PublishPress Planner Pro feature integrates your notifications with Slack. You can send notifications directly to a Slack channel and even reply without logging into WordPress.

[Click here to read about the Slack Notifications](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/slack/).

## Reminder Notifications ##

This PublishPress Planner Pro feature allows you to send notifications either before or after the publishing date for content. For example, before publication, you can send a reminder to editors, asking them to proof-read the post for publication. Or two or three days after publication, you can send a reminder to various team members, asking them to promote the post on social media.
